# Lesson 4.1 - New string functionality

With ES2015 comes powerful new feature in handling string. Generally, it is
referred to as `template literals`. You can now do really powerful things
using interpolation. Let's get started shall we?!

## Multi-line strings

One of the first neat things about template literals is that they can span
multiple lines:

```js
let myString = `
  This is a multi line string,
and it will preserve whitespace
    and newline characters
`
```

As you can see, this makes for creating long strings with newlines and whitespace
a very easy thing to do.

## String interpolation

Another super cool feature that has been a long time coming is interpolation.
Given an object `person`:

```js
let person = { name: 'Fred Flinstone', email: 'fred@slaterock.com' }
```

We can use it in a string like so:

```js
let welcome = `Welcome ${person.name}! We will be sending you a welcome email to ${person.email} shortly!`
```

Awesome! Much nicer to read that a series of concatenated strings, don't you
think?

It's also worth noting that anythin inside the `${ }` syntax will simply be
evaludated as JavaScript so you can 'literally' put anything you want in there
and it will be evaluated:

```bash
> console.log(`${2 * 2}`)
-> 4
```

## Custom interpolation

You can also use custom interpolation to create interpolated 'functions' with
custom behavior:

```js
strip`
   Welcome to Slate Rock ${person.name}
   We have sent your welcom package to ${person.email}
`
```

Wait a minute?!?! What the heck is going on here? Ok let's break it down. The
first thing we need is a function called `strip` that takes multiple arguments.
Let's create this function. The purpose here will be to strip all leading white
space from the multi line string.

```js
export function strip(pieces, ...values) {
  let str = '';

  pieces.forEach(function(piece, index) {
    let val = values[index] || '';
    str += piece + val;
  })

  return str.replace(/^\s*/gm, '');
}
```

Ok there's our function. What's happening with that function call from up above
there is we are actually calling the `strip` function with the template literal
as the argument. Behind the scenes the template literal is being dissected into
several parts. The first is an array of strings that is split anywhere the
interpolation syntax is found. The `rest` of the arguments are the pieces of
JavaScript themselves that have been evaluated.

Let's take this string for example:

```js
`Your name is ${person.name}`
```

That will produce the following arguments:

```js
strip(['Your name is', ''], 'Fred Flinstone')
```

So what our little `strip` function is doing is grabbing all of the pure strings
in the first argument, and then collecting the rest of the arguments into an
array called `values`. We can then build the string ourselves (really, this is
what JavaScript is doing behind the scenes) and add any extra functionality
that we need to!

## Moving on
Ok, so we've learned about template literals. Now let's put it into practice
and expand on the code we've been writing...
